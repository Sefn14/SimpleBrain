This is a simple response generation model that can be used to generate text based on a given prompt. It has a very basic design. It responds to prompts with a fixed response, meaning it does not learn or adapt over time.

### Features
- Fixed response generation
- Logging of prompts and responses
- Logging of user info

### Usage
To use the SimpleBrain model, you can follow these steps:
1. Install python 3.12.1 if you haven't already. You can download it from the official [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3121/) website. Or you can download it from Microsoft Store if you're using windows.
2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/@Sefn14/SimpleBrain.git
```
3. Run the main script `SimpleBrain.py` with Python 3.12.1:

```bash
python SimpleBrain.py
```

### Logging

The SimpleBrain model logs all user inputs and AI responses to a text file for future reference. This can be useful for reviewing past interactions and improving the model's performance.
